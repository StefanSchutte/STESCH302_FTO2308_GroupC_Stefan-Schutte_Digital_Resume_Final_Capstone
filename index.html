                    <p>To whom it may concern.<p>

                    <p>I hereby apply for a position at your organization/business.</p>
                    
                    <p>I completed my B.A. Communication Science degree in Media Studies and Journalism in 2015 at the University of the Free State. After University I have worked in the fruit industry as well as teaching English as a foreign language.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm ready for a challenge and want to prove myself. I am seeking experience and believe that I will be an asset for any business, because I am willing to do more than my share. I believe life is about experiences and I want to gain as much as possible and learn everything I can. I strongly feel that my work becomes the center of my life and therefore I would want a challenge that I would be able to define myself within.</p>
                    
                    <p>I hope that my application will be considerd favourably and I am looking forward to your prompt response.</p>
                    
                    Thank you.
