My landing page takes you to the header part. Here you can see my image as well as a hero image. Below the background image you will see a nav bar, which can be utilized to navigate throughout the page to different sections. THe nav bar is sticky and will stay at top of page throughout scrolling. There is also a direct link to Github and the Contact Details section.

The next section is the About page where I give a brief introduction of myself.

The next section is my Education section where I listed all my qualifications. I used CSS grid to display it in a well formatted manner. I placed it in an unordered list.
